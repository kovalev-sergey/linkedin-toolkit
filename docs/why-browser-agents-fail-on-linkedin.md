# Why browser agents fail on LinkedIn

Point Operator, Browser Use, a computer-use model, or a Playwright script at LinkedIn and it works
beautifully — for about twenty minutes. Then the search results thin out. Then a checkpoint page
appears. Then the account is restricted, and it is usually a real person's account, because
nobody makes a burner for a demo.

This happens to good engineers with well-written scripts, and the reason is not that the script
was bad. LinkedIn is one of the most aggressively defended consumer web properties in the world,
and browser automation is the specific thing it is defended against. Understanding *why* explains
why LinkedIn Toolkit is built the way it is — and why "just use a browser agent" is not a
solution waiting for better prompting.

## The four walls

### 1. Automation frameworks are trivially detectable

The most famous tell is `navigator.webdriver`, which is `true` in any WebDriver-controlled
browser. Patching it is the first thing every stealth plugin does, and it has not mattered in
years, because it was never the interesting signal.

What matters is that a browser driven by CDP is *different* in dozens of small ways that are
tedious to fake all at once. Headless Chrome historically shipped a different user-agent, a
different set of codecs, no `chrome.runtime`, and no plugin array. Automated profiles are fresh:
no history, no local storage, no service workers, no cached fonts. Canvas and WebGL fingerprints
from a virtualised GPU on a cloud host cluster into recognisable buckets — an unusual renderer
string, an unusual set of extensions, timing that is too consistent. Font enumeration on a minimal
Linux container returns a set no consumer laptop has ever had. `AudioContext` fingerprints differ
between real audio hardware and none.

Each signal on its own is weak. Combined into a single score, they are decisive, and the scoring
happens server-side where you cannot see it, on a model retrained continuously against traffic
from hundreds of millions of real sessions. You are not beating that with a patch list. The
`stealth` plugins are a permanent, losing arms race, and every article claiming otherwise is
older than the detector that broke it.

### 2. Datacenter IPs are their own confession

A cloud-hosted browser agent connects from AWS, GCP, Azure, or a VPS provider. Those ranges are
public, catalogued, and trivially matched. A LinkedIn account that has spent three years signing
in from a British residential ISP and suddenly appears from `us-east-1` is not a subtle event.

The commercial answer is residential proxy pools — real consumer IPs, resold. Set aside the price;
consider the provenance. A large fraction of residential proxy capacity comes from consumer
devices whose owners agreed to it inside the terms of a free VPN or SDK they installed for another
reason. You are routing an authenticated session that holds your professional identity through a
stranger's home router. And LinkedIn buys the same lists the proxy vendors sell from, so a decent
share of that capacity is already flagged. You pay a premium to look *more* suspicious.

There is also the geography problem: rotating IPs means an account that appears in Frankfurt, then
Ohio, then São Paulo within an hour. Impossible-travel detection is not advanced security. It is a
timestamp and a subtraction.

### 3. Machine timing does not look human

This is the wall people underestimate most, and it is the one that survives every fingerprint fix.

A human browsing LinkedIn produces jagged telemetry. They open a profile, read for eleven seconds,
scroll two thirds of the way, go back, open two more in tabs, get distracted, return four minutes
later. Mouse paths curve and overshoot. Scroll velocity varies. Dwell time correlates with how
interesting the page was. Activity clusters into work hours, thins at lunch, and stops overnight.

A script produces a metronome. Profile, 2.0s, profile, 2.0s, profile, 2.0s — a hundred times, at
04:12 on a Sunday, in perfect page order, with no scroll events and no mouse movement at all. Add
`random.uniform(1, 3)` and you have a uniform distribution, which is *also* not what humans
produce; real inter-action gaps are heavy-tailed, with occasional very long pauses. The rhythm is
the fingerprint, and it is far harder to fake convincingly than a user-agent string.

Volume compounds it. Rate limiting on LinkedIn is not one number. Invites, messages, searches,
profile views and connection requests are counted separately, over rolling hourly, daily and
weekly windows, weighted by account age, connection count, historical activity, and — critically —
the acceptance rate on invites you have already sent. An unattended agent has no idea where it
sits against any of that until it crosses a line.

### 4. Challenges break agents in a way they do not break humans

When something scores badly, LinkedIn does not return an error. It returns a **checkpoint**: a
CAPTCHA, an email verification, an SMS code, a "confirm it's you" interstitial. Sometimes it
degrades silently instead — search returns 10 results where it returned 100, and nothing says why.

A human sees the checkpoint, solves it, and moves on, and the account is often fine. An agent sees
an unexpected DOM, fails to find the selector it wanted, and — because that is what retry logic
does — tries again. And again. Each retry is another datapoint confirming the classification.
Restriction usually follows not from the original suspicious behaviour but from the *reaction* to
being challenged.

Silent degradation is worse. Your agent reports success, your CSV has 47 rows instead of 300, and
you do not find out until someone asks why the campaign underperformed.

## The other failure: hard-coded endpoints

The four walls are why *browser* agents get caught. There is a second failure mode, and it is the
one that quietly killed a generation of LinkedIn extensions that never got anywhere near a
checkpoint.

LinkedIn's web client now serves nearly all of its data through a single GraphQL entry point:
`GET /voyager/api/graphql?queryId=<name>.<32-hex hash>&variables=(...)`. The name is stable; the
hash is not. It is a build artefact of the web client, and it changes with each release — the
client that produced the IDs in [voyager-endpoints.md](voyager-endpoints.md) is 1.13.46474. The
older REST-style Voyager paths that essentially every 2024–2025 extension hard-coded — the tidy
`/voyager/api/identity/...` and `/voyager/api/search/...` URLs you will find in a hundred blog
posts and dead GitHub repos — now return 400, 410 or 500.

That is the mechanism. Not a ban wave, not a detection upgrade: a URL that stopped existing.
Extensions built as a fixed list of endpoints had no way to notice, no way to report it, and in
most cases no maintainer left to fix it. They simply returned empty results, and users assumed
their accounts had been flagged.

It also explains a move the commercial vendors made. If your automation runs on your own
servers, a query-ID change is a deploy: you patch centrally, once, and every customer is working
again within the hour. If it runs in the user's browser, every user has to install an update. The
cloud vendors took the operationally easier path — and the price of that convenience is paid by the
account, not the vendor. Running the automation server-side means the session that identifies you
on LinkedIn has to be held server-side too: your cookie leaves your machine, sits in someone
else's database alongside every other customer's, and is used from their IP ranges rather than
yours. You are trading a maintenance problem for a custody problem.

We took the harder path, so here is the honest version of what it costs. LinkedIn Toolkit calls
the same GraphQL queries the LinkedIn page calls, from inside your own tab, and every query ID
lives in one table — [voyager-endpoints.md](voyager-endpoints.md) — with the date it was captured
and the client version it came from. `lit endpoints check` runs them and reports each as ok,
failed or unverified, so you learn about drift from a command rather than from a suspiciously
empty CSV. Drift is then a maintenance task, not an architecture change: you edit a table.

Those IDs *will* drift, and this project needs contributors to re-capture them. Doing it takes a
few minutes. Open LinkedIn in Chrome with DevTools on, filter the Network tab for `voyager/api`,
perform the action by hand — run the search, open the profile — and copy the `queryId` parameter
from the request the page itself makes; that is the current hash, by definition. The same hashes
appear as literal strings inside LinkedIn's JavaScript bundles, so grepping a bundle works too and
is easier to script. Then open a PR against the table with the new hash, the date, and the client
version from the page. That is the whole job.

## What LinkedIn Toolkit does instead

The insight is not clever. It is that **the safest place to call LinkedIn from is the LinkedIn tab
you already have open.**

LinkedIn's own web app is a single-page application talking to an internal JSON API — Voyager,
under `/voyager/api/`. Every search, profile load and message send you do by hand is a `fetch()`
from that page, authenticated by session cookies, carrying a CSRF token. When the extension makes
one of those calls, it is doing exactly what the page does, from the page's own origin.

Which means:

- **No fingerprint delta.** It is your real Chrome, your real profile, your real history, your
  real GPU, your real fonts, your real extensions. There is nothing to patch because nothing is
  synthetic.
- **No IP delta.** Your home or office connection, the one the account has always used. No
  proxies, no rotation, no impossible travel.
- **No session theft.** No cookie is exported, imported, or shared. There is no hosted session,
  because there is no host. If you are not logged into LinkedIn in Chrome, the tool does nothing.
- **Human pacing by construction.** The engine spaces every action with jittered delays,
  daily caps, a business-hours window, and a 14-day warm-up ramp for new accounts. The
  caps are enforced in the extension, below every client: 100 invites, 150 messages, 500 profile
  visits, 1,000 search results per day, and no MCP call, CLI flag or config file can raise them.
- **Challenges stop everything.** A security check — a 451, or the far more usual redirect to
  LinkedIn's checkpoint page — pauses every request immediately and notifies you. A 429 backs off
  and surfaces `nextAllowedAt`. After a check nothing resumes until a human has completed it and
  cleared it in the popup. There is no retry loop anywhere in the codebase. See
  [captcha-and-security-checks.md](captcha-and-security-checks.md).
- **A human in the loop by default.** Copilot mode queues every agent-originated write for
  approval. Turning that off is a toggle in the popup that only a person can flip.

And for the agent specifically: it gets typed JSON, not pixels. A browser agent sourcing 100
profiles takes hundreds of screenshots, burns vision tokens on each, and misreads a third of them.
Here, `linkedin_search_people` returns 100 structured profiles in one tool call, and
`linkedin_get_profile` returns a typed object. Errors are structured too — `RATE_LIMITED` with a
`retryAfter`, `CHALLENGE_DETECTED` with instructions — so the agent explains what happened instead
of thrashing against a wall it cannot see.

## What it explicitly does not do

Being clear about this matters, because the line between "automating your own account" and
"attacking a platform" is exactly where a project like this earns or loses trust.

- **No security measure is bypassed.** No CAPTCHA solving, no challenge circumvention, no
  detection evasion. When LinkedIn challenges, the tool stops and hands the problem to a human.
- **No proxies, no residential IPs, no fingerprint spoofing.** Your connection, your device.
- **No cookie theft, import, or sharing.** No hosted sessions, no multi-account farming, no
  operating an account you are not signed into.
- **No headless browser.** No Playwright, Puppeteer, or CDP anywhere in the repository, including
  the test suite. The examples run against a fake extension client, not a real browser.
- **No unauthenticated scraping.** Everything happens inside a session a real person opened by
  logging in normally.

## The part that does not go away

None of this makes automation permitted. LinkedIn's User Agreement prohibits automated access, and
that clause does not have a "but I paced it nicely" exception. This tool reduces the technical
risk of detection substantially. It cannot reduce the contractual position at all.

So: use your own account, understand what you are agreeing to, keep the volumes conservative, keep
a human in the loop, and do not automate anything you would be embarrassed to have sent by hand.
The full picture is in [safety.md](safety.md).

The point of building it this way was never to win an arms race with LinkedIn's detection team. It
was to make the arms race unnecessary — because the traffic genuinely *is* what it claims to be: a
person using their own LinkedIn account, with a very well-organised assistant.

Which removes the fingerprint and the IP from the equation, and nothing else. Volume and rhythm are
still perfectly visible to LinkedIn, and they are still counted against you — that is precisely why
the caps are enforced in the extension and cannot be raised. Once the easy tells are gone, doing
less is the only defence left.
