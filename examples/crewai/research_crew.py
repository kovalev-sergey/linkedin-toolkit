CrewAI · LinkedIn Toolkit

Two agents, two tasks: a sourcer builds a shortlist, a writer drafts the outreach. Every draft
lands in the human approval queue.

    pip install -r requirements.txt
    export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
    export LINKEDIN_TOOLKIT_TOKEN=$(jq -r '.token' ~/.linkedin-toolkit/config.json)
    python research_crew.py "Heads of data engineering at Series B fintechs in London"

Requires `lit serve --http` (add --fake to run without a LinkedIn account).
