/**
 * LinkedIn Toolkit — the approval queue (Copilot mode).
 *
 * Agent-originated writes land here instead of going to LinkedIn, and wait for
 * a human. Approving one runs it through the outreach send path with origin
 * `approved`, which bypasses the queue but *not* the quotas.
 *
 * Approving and sending are two separate things. `approve()` marks items and
 * returns; `sendApproved()` — kicked immediately and then run by the queue
 * alarm every minute — sends them one at a time at human pace. They were one
 * call until 2026-09-09, and the result was that approving three invitations
 * held the bridge open for well over a minute while the pacing delays ran, so
 * `lit queue approve` timed out and answered nothing while the sends carried
 * on behind it (issue #21).
 *
 * The executor is installed by outreach.js (`setExecutor`) rather than
 * imported, so the two modules do not form an import cycle.
