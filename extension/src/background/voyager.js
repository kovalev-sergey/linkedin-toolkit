/**
 * LinkedIn Toolkit — Voyager endpoints.
 *
 * Every LinkedIn call the engine makes lives here, using the user's own
 * logged-in session. Response shaping lives in `voyager-normalize.js`, reading
 * the normalized envelope through `normalized.js`; the transport lives in
 * `voyager-core.js`.
 *
 * LinkedIn's web client moved almost everything off the old REST paths and
 * onto persisted GraphQL queries, each identified by a `queryId` that changes
 * when LinkedIn ships a new bundle. Every one of those ids, every decoration
 * id and every surviving REST path is in the `ENDPOINTS` table below and
 * nowhere else, so refreshing them after a LinkedIn release is a single edit —
 * see `docs/voyager-endpoints.md` for how to re-capture them.
